sudoku-solver
=============

Sudoku-solver is designed for solving the 9x9 sudoku puzzles. 
It uses a Depth First Search Method and stops as soon as it finds a solution.

- To run the program, clone the repository and make changes in the line 128 of the file sudoku-solver.py to test 
  for different files.
  
- In the input files, the number after'-' indicates the number of solutions possible for the given puzzle.
  E.g. state0-1sol.txt can have 1 solution
